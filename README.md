- 👋 Hi, I’m Research Student from NIT Goa, India
- 👀 I’m interested in applied machine learning for Critical Care Informatics and Physiological Signal Processing. 
      During my Ph.D I have developed machine learning algorithms for early prediction of sepsis using EHRs from ICU by applying Tensor Decomposition schemes.
      Have also worked on sleep-arousal classification using different physiological signals like ECG,EEG,EMG, SpO2 etc, and Heart sound classification using PPG signals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning concepts of Multi-Modal analysis, and Graph Signal Processing. Developing 12-lead ECG classification alogorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research related to health care informatics and physiological signal processing.
- 📫 You can  reach me @ naimahmed.nesaragi@gmail.com
